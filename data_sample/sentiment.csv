üî•UPDATED CHEATSHEET ü§´üëá

‚ùå NO GALXE PASSPORT REQUIRED üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Almost all of the projects will have some form of social tasks, such as follow on Twitter and join Discord (all tracked via Galxe). Suggest you start linking your socials to Galxe and joining the projects‚Äô Discord/Twitter for a head start
2Ô∏è‚É£ NONE of the projects currently use the controversial Galxe Passport, so don‚Äôt worry anon - you won‚Äôt be asked to get it in order to participate in the campaign üòâ. This has been confirmed by a member of Optimism team on our Twitter. 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Both Kwenta and Stargate are planning to gib EXTRA NFT reward üéÅfor users that complete their quests. These NFTs will have utility, e.g. Kwenta NFT will boost your LP rewards üëÄü§ë
4Ô∏è‚É£ We now know the list of all 18 (as we thought!) projects. It‚Äôs a mixed bag between Op-native and non-native apps, likely picked by TVL and other metrics. Interestingly, neither Thales nor Aelin are on the list - probably due to their relatively lower TVL in comparison to other Op-native apps. 
5Ô∏è‚É£ Some of the quest tasks have been mentioned in the Galxe x Optimism Twitter Spaces üéß. See an up-to-date version of the infamous cheat-sheet.
