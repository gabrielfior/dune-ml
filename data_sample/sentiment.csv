But It is highly recommended to do SL+ or close the trade immediately (clear) or partial taking profit

Not invitation to buy or trade, just my opinion and stupid ideas to trade this pair😂🙏🏼

90,"Hey anon, there’s more 🚨 alpha 🚨 that we managed to find out wrt to the next week’s Optimism Quests 👇:

🔥UPDATED CHEATSHEET 🤫👇

❌ NO GALXE PASSPORT REQUIRED 👇

1️⃣ Almost all of the projects will have some form of social tasks, such as follow on Twitter and join Discord (all tracked via Galxe). Suggest you start linking your socials to Galxe and joining the projects’ Discord/Twitter for a head start
2️⃣ NONE of the projects currently use the controversial Galxe Passport, so don’t worry anon - you won’t be asked to get it in order to participate in the campaign 😉. This has been confirmed by a member of Optimism team on our Twitter. 
3️⃣ Both Kwenta and Stargate are planning to gib EXTRA NFT reward 🎁for users that complete their quests. These NFTs will have utility, e.g. Kwenta NFT will boost your LP rewards 👀🤑
4️⃣ We now know the list of all 18 (as we thought!) projects. It’s a mixed bag between Op-native and non-native apps, likely picked by TVL and other metrics. Interestingly, neither Thales nor Aelin are on the list - probably due to their relatively lower TVL in comparison to other Op-native apps. 
5️⃣ Some of the quest tasks have been mentioned in the Galxe x Optimism Twitter Spaces 🎧. See an up-to-date version of the infamous cheat-sheet. We expect confirmation of all details on Monday (19 Sept), but never forget who told you about all of this first 😜😉",2022-09-17 16:58:04+00:00,2022-09-17,Negative,0.43652358651161194
